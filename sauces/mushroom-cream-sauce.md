## Ingredients

- 8 oz. Cremini/baby bella mushrooms or other mushroom mix, chopped into desired size
- Half stick (4 tbsp.) butter
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 medium shallot, finely chopped
- Small amount of dry wine (red or white both work depending on what you are serving it with)
- 1 c. heavy cream
- Parsley leaves to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt half of the butter (so about 2 tbsp.) over medium heat until done foaming
2. Add garlic and shallot, sauteing until fragrant
3. Add chopped mushrooms, saute until mushrooms begin to soften, then add in a dash of wine (sorry I don't measure this, but it should be forgiving).
4. Continue to saute until wine has almost completely evaporated. Should be around 5 minutes if I recall correctly.
5. Add in the remaining butter, stirring occasionally until melted.
6. Add in cream and stir until the mixture is bubbling. The sauce will start to thicken, but will also thicken when you let it cool, so just get the texture to where you feel it's a little bit thinner than you want, pull the pan off of the burner.
7. Stir in parsley and wait for the sauce to cool. Stirring will tell you when the thickness is right for serving.
